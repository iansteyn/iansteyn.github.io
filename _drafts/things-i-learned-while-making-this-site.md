## Initially
Some things I had to learn just to get set up:
- How to set up a domain with cloudflare
- How to connect and verify the domain for my GitHub Pages repo
  - Some DNS stuff I've already forgotten

## In the upgrade (now)
- More Docker usage
- YAML frontmatter
- what SSGs are

- CSS
  - refreshing on grid and flexbox layouts
  - BEM potentially
